## **Form Builder backend**

### **Problem Statement**

Almost everyone has worked with Google Forms at least once. Itâ€™s an application that allows you to create and publish
custom forms. In this small exercise, we are not going to build a comprehensive form builder. Instead, we aim to create
a simplified model of it.

We will design a small REST API that allows us to create forms and manage their data through a client application. The
client should be able to retrieve the data and display it appropriately.

### **Data Models**

This program includes a **Form** class with the following attributes:

1. A **unique identifier** (ID).
2. A **name**.
3. A **publish status** (whether the form is published or unpublished).
4. A **set of fields** (each field should be an object of the Field class).
5. A **Submit** button at the end (with methods and endpoints defined).

Each **Field** must include the following attributes:

- A **unique ID** (unique within the form).
- A **label**.
- A **field name**.
- A **type** (e.g., text, number).
- A **default value**.

### **Supported Field Types**

The program must support at least the following field types:

1. **Text**
2. **Number**
3. **Boolean** (Checkbox)
4. **Date**

### **REST API Endpoints**

The REST API must include endpoints for managing forms, as shown in the table below:

| Endpoint Path                 | HTTP Method | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /forms/                      | GET         | Retrieve a list of all forms.                                               |
| /forms/                      | POST        | Create a new form.                                                          |
| /forms/{id}                  | GET         | Retrieve a form by its ID.                                                  |
| /forms/{id}                  | PUT         | Update the information of a specific form.                                  |
| /forms/{id}                  | DELETE      | Delete a form.                                                              |
| /forms/{id}/fields           | GET         | View the fields of a specific form.                                         |
| /forms/{id}/fields           | PUT         | Update the fields of a form.                                                |
| /forms/{id}/publish          | POST        | Toggle the publication status of a form. If published, set it to unpublished and vice-versa. |
| /forms/{id}/published        | GET         | Retrieve a list of published forms.                                         |

### **Database Requirements**

Forms must be stored and retrieved from a database. The relationships between forms and fields should be managed
properly. For this purpose, **Spring Data** should be used to ensure proper entity management.

### **Important Notes**

1. **General Requirements**:
    - Handle errors gracefully.
    - Use **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** for communication between the client and server.
    - Leverage **Spring Data** for database design and implementation.
    - Implement other required functionalities as needed.

2. **Backend Only**:
    - This project is strictly **backend-focused** and does **not require frontend implementation**.
    - Use tools like **Postman** to test the program if necessary.
